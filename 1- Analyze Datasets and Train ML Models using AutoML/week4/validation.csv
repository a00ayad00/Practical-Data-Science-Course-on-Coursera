__label__-1 "this dress is just too baggy overall . i am 5 ' 6 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering . i ca n't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me . it was already a little high on the small ."
__label__0 "this tunic is way over priced for the style and quality . it fit comfortably ( runs a size larger ) but it 's not really flattering it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well . this top does not support the price at all . it felt like something i could find at department store for way less . i will be returning it ."
__label__-1 "received this in the mail today and was disappointed . i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all . the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body . needless to say i will be returning this item"
__label__1 "yes ! i love the color the fabric and the fit up top . the skirt however is very poofy . i am going to let it hang for awhile ( it was an online order ) and see if some of that relaxes . otherwise i will need to return it ."
__label__-1 "i was really excited about this sweater but the fit was terrible . the sleeves were the right size but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape . they must have clipped the sweater on the model . for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small ."
__label__-1 "do n't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger . order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size . i ordered an xs and it 's more like a medium or large ."
__label__0 "this top was really cute on someone else but not on me ... on me ti was too big and the color washed me out . the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too just not on porcelain skin ... like many tops this season it is a bit boxy but looks nice with jeans white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt . i would probably size down a bot ..."
__label__0 "the quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty . it just made me look super wide . i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist . it just was n't going to work for my body . maybe a different size would work but i do n't like it enough to try ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress and after i got it on . as others mentioned it is difficult to get it on . i wish that the bow snapped on and off . as i took the dress off the bow came off itself . unfortunately going to be returning the dress ."

__label__0 "i tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide . they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex . the stripes are really cute the cut is just very strange . for reference the black and white is the small the taupe is the xxs ."
__label__-1 "quality was not what you expect from retailer especially for the price . top is lined but skirt is not . material is tissue paper thin and see thru . there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat it keeps popping up . however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives . was returned ."

__label__1 "so this shirt is very cute i like the drape ( if you can get it arranged properly ) but it is not black more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy . i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet . i am keeping it thinking i will wear it with leather since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different . i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine . a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker ."
__label__0 "beautiful top marred only by the armholes . i tried a small and a medium but alas my bra showed under the arms . i my be overly endowed for this top but the way it cuts you would have to be braless to wear it . not for me but wish it worked . it is really pretty ."
__label__-1 "i loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric . i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned . totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge . maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try . also the lavender color is really washed out ..."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top but had 2 major problems with it . first it 's not for short girls . i 'm only 5 ' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise . the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt which was terribly unflattering . second the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking . no regrets on returning this one ."
__label__-1 "in paper crown dresses i wear a small or size 6 so for this top i ordered a small . it was huge on me ! for reference i 'm 5 ' 7 130 lbs 34a . it is very wide towards the bottom and it flares out way more than in the picture . the material is also a little stiff so it really sticks out . even if i sized down to the xs i think the bottom would still look unflattering so i 'm returning this ."
__label__0 "this is a truly beautiful dress and yes so much better in person . upon examining the dress however i saw some problems . the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places there were some frayed ends and even some & # 39 ; fuzzy & # 39 ; spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something . the dress is over $ 250 and for that price i expect the embroidery to be top-notch . returning and hope the replacement is in better shape . if so it will be a keeper !"
__label__0 "this dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms ) . but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off as i fix one shoulder another will slide down . the material is nice but since it is not lined it feels inexpensive disposable ."
__label__1 "this vest is the one thing i will wear all year round . i could n't wait for this to arrive it looks and fits just like the pictures . great quality and value is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit . i have worn it several times and in addition to looking great does keep you warm ."
__label__-1 "i really loved this in the catalog . the fabric and details are very pretty . however it 's a lot of fabric without much form . my husband suggested it for maternity ( not realizing it has fitted slip ) . not for curvy/ hourglass . had to send it back ."
__label__1 "i definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender . the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem . but it is somewhat boxy and flowy which did n't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise ."
__label__-1 "unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle ) . also there are no bra-straps holders and my bra straps did show up a lot ..."
__label__-1 "the cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but did n't flatter my shape . i think it would work better on someone very thin . the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and did n't sit right . even worse the bust portion made me look flat ( and i 'm a full c cup ) ."
__label__0 "i thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu . the color is nice the neck is cute but the form unflattering . i 'm trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back ."

__label__1 "this top is cute ! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality . the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy . as another reviewer pointed out the peplum is only in the front ! it sounds really weird but i do n't really mind the look because i 'll be wearing a jacket over it . i 'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully ."
__label__1 "i was n't expecting much out of this when i was in the store but liked the colors and thought i 'd try it out . grabbed a s and xs ( i 'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes ) - the s fit perfectly ( tts ) and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit . it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue . in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me ... falling low"

__label__1 "i a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket . the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design . be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge . i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue ."
__label__0 "let me start by saying that i can not wear wool . it does n't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere it makes me itch so much that i just ca n't do it and i did n't not find this as itchy as others stated . that being said you definitely need to size down . i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric . i still do n't know what to think . i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point ."
__label__1 "perfect fit . this dress is super flattering the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on . the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage . the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty ! the perfect spring to summer dress !"
__label__0 "this is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to ... it 's just simply richer and prettier in person . there 's a nice drape to the fabric but it 's cut pretty short and wide which is n't flattering imo unless you are very petite and have a small bust . i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me . i would have given it a higher star rat"
__label__1 "i completely disagree with the previous review . i purchased this dress and i absolutely love it ! i went out for a couple occasions ( one being special and the other not so special ) and both times i received compliments all night ! my husband loves it and that really says a lot . i feel the dress runs true to size and the quality is right where it should be ... runway worthy ... absolutely ! .... worth $ 3000 's + ? .... probably not but i personally ca n't afford that anyway . i 'm so happy to have found th"

__label__-1 "this top is huge ! i 'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge . it 's wider than it is long . even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric . i 'm so disappointed ! beautiful color and fabric but there 's so much fabric . i love a flowy top but this one is way too much . : ( i will be returning this top ."

__label__-1 "as another reviewer wrote .. this is not the same jean featured on the website . same cut and style but it 's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees . i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them . i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure ."

__label__0 "i tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted just another cover-up . in the final analysis even at $ 35 ( 30 % off 49.99 ) it just hung there . if that 's what you 're after then this is for you ."
__label__0 "i wanted to like this top as i usually adore a cute peplum feature . when i tried it on yesterday in the store i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it . i am petite ( 5 ' 2 110 lbs ) and i tried my usual xs . the fabric was substantial and of a high quality but unfortunately in this design that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me . it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt ! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing ."
__label__0 "i 'm surprised this worked for so many people . for me this dress fit terribly . however the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made . i am 5 ' 3 and about 117 with a really short torso and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have . i think the bodice was just too long for me . the neckline was also too low . on someone taller or maybe with a longer torso i could see this dress being really lovely ."
__label__0 "this sweater is really cute great fit and unique style . unfortunately the ivory color was more yellow than i like . not the right shade for my skin tone ."
__label__0 "i had high hopes after reading all of the reviews but as you can see the dress did n't live up to them . i ordered a size 8 and maybe a 6 would 've fit better but i 'm not going to find out . the sheer area on the model really stands out ; it does not in real life . there were loose threads throughout and there really should n't be at this price point . i was going to wear this to a wedding but as a member of the wedding party i do n't think it would picture well at all . i 'm sorry that it 's headed"
__label__1 "i liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail . i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect . it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist . the bottom is flowy . i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that was n't a surprise but i really wish it came lined . no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it 's too nice for a cover up ."
__label__-1 "if you have any curves avoid ! it is not flattering . the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress ."
__label__-1 "agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape . unflattering overall . i normally wear a size 2 of 4 and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare . unlined and it itches !"

__label__1 "i bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom . absolutely loved it ! i am 52 so the dress is part is a bit long for me -- -ended up wearing my 4.5 inch heels to make it fit . the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures . but that makes it more formal . it 's great !"
__label__1 "love this blouse . the owl design is flawless front to back . the material has a silk like feeling . i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer . if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you . also i am a 38 c and the chest fit well ( in size large ) but would not offer much more room for a larger chest . if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows i would size up . i love the unique design !"

__label__1 "love love this dress . fits so great . i normally would n't have picked this dress . more preppy than my normal style . fits amazing . my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i 've ever owned . the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts ."
__label__1 "the material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design . it looks very elegant and romantic . you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though because of the design of the straps . it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering . the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath . overall very pretty and i would highly recommend . ( i purchased the white and yellow version . )"
__label__0 "so i thought this sweater would be snowy white but it 's actually a beige kind of dingy color . i do not mean that it 's unattractive i do like it just because it is not snowy white like i thought it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater . it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured . it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either . it 's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no"

__label__1 "this is the first maxi i purchased this summer . i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i did n't want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom . it is a beautiful flowy dress . no need for a slip . it has beads on the bodice . i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up would n't have made that much of a difference .. kinda uncomfortable in the chest area . has yet to be worn so may return .."

__label__-1 "i was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress . this was not it . completely see through . i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up . but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip . its an odd design . absolutely not worth the price . i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress . returned this piece without looking back"
__label__1 "it 's definitely not a $ 100 blouse but i took advantage of the sale on sale and got ta say i love it ! it 's slightly sheer but with a plain nude bra it 's fine . beautiful details very retro light and breezy . wearing it to work and with jeans ."

__label__0 "i had reservations about this top based on other reviews but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances . i have an athletic build -- not model-thin but not dumpy either -- and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly . the sleeves were especially unflattering . i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs ."

__label__0 "love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back . also it is a flowly top so you will need to size down . however because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms . this did n't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type ( as in not the model type ) . i am not overweight but it definitely did n't flatter my chest area . seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first ."

__label__0 "i agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla ; it is more beige color . i liked the dress a lot it had a flattering fit on me extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress . it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture . it poked out on both sides at least 1 which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting . i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct"

__label__0 "i love the design of this sweater and ordered it online but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived . also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo still a type of ivory but a little yellow-y . the sweater was solid looking but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i 'm not sure how well it would have worn over time . flattering cut . i liked how it fit but for the price and fabric i decided to return it . unfortunate to lose money on shipping ."
__label__0 "just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress ! you ca n't tell from the pictures . i ordered thinking it was a dress but it 's actually ... culottes ? i 'm not sure what you would call it . the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky . it definitely goes back !"
__label__1 "i was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors .. it is comfy and thin . i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe .."
__label__-1 "this shirt aesthetically is very pleasing . i love the overall design and colors . however when i tried it on i was immediately itchy ! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be . in addition though i ordered a size medium it fit very large - almost too oversized . the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big . it 's too bad i really loved the look but i 'm not the type to layer . if you are go for it but get a size smaller than you normally would !"
__label__1 "i agree with the other reviewer -- this is classic retailer old-style quality . the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical . the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist . i usually choose s/m in cardigans ( for ref 5 ' 8 135 lbs 34-b ) but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me . i think it just depends what you are looking for . unique it is and certainly lovely ."
__label__0 "the style of this dress is quite lovely i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes ... unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure i should mention that i am 5 ' 9 and have an athletic figure but with hips . the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric . but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase . also the"

__label__-1 "this jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif . however it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store . this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time . it 's a big shame because it 's so perfect in every other way . i choose not to buy it . it 's very expensive for the quality ."
__label__-1 "this top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color . the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes . one side you could see the top of my bra the other side was below the side of my bra . you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole it was that big . this went back will not re-order . i usually order xs or xsp this was an xsp ."

__label__1 "i tried on almost every dress in the shop today and this is the dress . as soon as i tried it on i started twirling around . i felt beautiful and i could n't stop smiling . my mother said that it makes my blue eyes glow . it flatters my figure by hanging perfectly across my bust-line floating over my curves and camouflaging my little unappealing bumps . also the dress is cut nicely under the arms which allows coverage for a strapless bra . i chose the medium size even though i usually wear a large"
__label__-1 "the fabric was nothing special ( i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric but this was stiff feeling ) and the pattern was cute . but what made me return it was the fact that 1 ) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint . literally . puffy . paint . and 2 ) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived . parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it . i could barely unfold it . i 'm sure this could have been cute but who wants a top that looks lik"
__label__0 "it 's a very cute design . it looks great tucked into a cute pair of jeans if can even be dressed up . however i agree with the previous comments about the top not staying folded down . it likes to ride up and is difficult to keep the style like the model in the picture has . it 's a very cute design it just needs to be worked with and adjusted time and time again as its worn . when it does cooperate i 've gotten many compliments on it ! order a size up i am normally a small but the medium worked be"
__label__1 "recently bought these on sale though they were still a bit in the expensive side . i 'm 5 ' 2 and typically a size 4 the xs fits perfectly . the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model but i 'm fine with that . the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy as sometimes happens with this style ."
__label__1 "great top lately i 've been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure & good tops but in this one the xs was best . i bought this in 3 colors and they 're my go to tanks for summer . the mint is a bit sheer but not bad . i did not get try the yellow or white one ."
__label__-1 "i purchased this shirt in white and black . the white is more ivory-isn and is a bit thin/see through . the shirts can be worn with jeans or dressed up with a skirt . i just wish it was a little more form fitting . i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric ! very comfortable as well !"
__label__0 "this immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern and the fabric is actually quite nice . the fit is at least a size or two too large though with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down . my normal 4 was big everywhere and the 2 was still big in the chest but fit everywhere else . the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas but the top section just did n't work for me . maybe better for someone better endowed ?"
__label__1 "this pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic . i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others did n't . the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring . overall cute especially for the price . if not on sale i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome ."
__label__0 "bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost . fabric feels cheap like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly . did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack . gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag . returned it ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store . but i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash ( even when following washing instructions ) . i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially ! i 'm so disappointed . how can you make a shirt that ca n't withstand washing ? !"

__label__0 "i fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite . it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything . it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me . it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just did n't lay down well bunching out on the sides in a way i did n't find to be very flattering . so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm but 3 stars for actual fit on . alas it is going"
__label__0 "the quality and color is great on this top . the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look . and to wear it as a cowl neck ( or actually looks like a boat neck ) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look . it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right . the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other ."
__label__-1 "like other reviewers have said this item runs extremely long and large . i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide -- much wider than any standard wide leg pant i 've owned . sadly had to return ."

__label__-1 "i purchased this dress in the green and while the print and material were lovely the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top . the billowly bottom made it look like a bag . i am 5ft 36d and 29 waist and the size 2 fit which makes me think this runs large ! i 'll be returning this dress ."
__label__1 "1. i 'm 5 ' 5 tall 145 lbs and 38-32-40. i 'm normally a size 10 but i took a 12 in this skirt . 2. it 's comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in . 3. sits at high waist . hem hits below the knee . 4. i did n't like the buttons . they are very round and stick out quite far . they are also mismatched . i would have liked them better if they were flatter . 5. i also did n't like the mustard color . it 's unflattering to me ."
__label__-1 "i was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts . unfortunately this fell short as it was huge . not only was it big it flared at the bottom . it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump but not what i am going for right now . if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i 'm sad that i 'll have to return it ."
__label__0 "i thought this top was absolutely beautiful ! i could n't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me . ( i 'm 5 ft 105 lbs and got the pxs ) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit . i 'm very disappointed i really wanted this top to work ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater . the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw . but it is lightweight and delicate . i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly . i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness i had to say no . i will watch for sale ."
__label__0 "these pants are cute . they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model . they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt . these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly . since they already run a bit big this is a major negative . i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home . by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants ."
__label__0 "this top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides . it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric . clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her . it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it 's going back ."
__label__1 "i like that you can dress this shirt up or down . go out or lounge in it ! very comfortable and i would recommend buying it ."
__label__1 "i ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5 ' 8 with a long-ish torso . i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it 's fairly short . color was gorgeous . the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me . those with small chests may have better luck . i left like a suburban mom in it ."
__label__1 "i ordered these in the pinkish color and i love them ! i 'm 5 ' 8 140 lbs . and the size small fits perfectly . they are definitely sheer but they 're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected . these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini bandeau or even tankini . the price is great especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms . no pockets is the only negative ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this . i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock . i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer . unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange . it cut my off in the most unflattering spot ."
__label__0 "i feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee . it 's a lovely pattern and i like the fit ( it 's not clingy ) but it 's a bit see-though . it 's not as bad as the other tee but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt ( unless that 's your thing ) . that said i 'm happy with it because it 's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather . i am very glad i got it on sale though . i would n't have paid full price for it ."
__label__1 "love this skirt ! it 's definitely on the tight side but is a stretchy material . i 'm between a 6 and an 8 and went with the six because i liked the way it hugged my curves . as an hourglass shape i sometimes have problems finding pencil skirts - they either fit in the hips and are big at the waitband or the other way around . this one fit great throughout and was both slimming in the front and flattering in the back . i was also worried that if i tucked anything into this skirt there would be weird"
__label__0 "this is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it . the fit is great love the side zippers . i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed . nothing i cant get rid of ( till next time i carry a bag ! ) but if this keeps up there soon wo n't be much of a shirt left . very disappointing for the price . was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality ."

__label__0 "this vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful but the fit is very off . you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs and made my waist look wide . it also ran small ."

__label__1 "i purchased this top on 2 colors ... a great go to .... stylish soft and very comfortable ."
__label__-1 "this dress is not flattering . the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy . like the other reviewer said its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through . it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it did n't help regardless . the length is not accurate either . i would say it 's a pretty short dress ( mid thigh ) but that probably depends on the person . it also makes you look very horizontal . i was really excited about this dress but it 's getting r"

__label__0 "i like this top but unfortunately i will be returning . it 's way too long . the color is pretty as is the design minus the length . it makes it look frumpy . maybe if they offered it in petite or if you 're taller it would work for you ."

__label__-1 "this might look good on you if you are very tall and slim . i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places . the color is not true : it is black stripes on gray ( not cream ) . i thought the stripes might flatter my shape but alas i did not look good in this . the material is very nice soft and stretchy ."
__label__1 "this dress is so pretty ! ! the second i saw it i knew i had to have it . make sure to get a smaller size because it can be a little big towards the waist as a result of the dress ' design ."
__label__1 "the picture does n't do it justice . i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing . the fit is true to size . i am large chested but it fit comfortable ... i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest . still looks amazing . i feel very feminine in this blouse . good quality material ."
__label__0 "i loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail . as soon as i put it on though i was drowning in it . i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it . i still really like it and wish it would have worked . i am 5 ' 5 athletic/slim figure just for reference ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this jacket . so soft and great color . unfortunately it is just too light weight . it is almost like shirt fabric . nice heft to the fabric though . nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me . i am 5'10 and 135lbs . the small was the right size . i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer ."
__label__0 "the colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color . size is a bit on the large size . i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear . i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans black pants etc and this did not fit that need . it would be a warm jacket if that is a need ."
__label__-1 "c'mon . the accent is wrong ! a simple google search would prevent this ."
__label__0 "loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer ."
__label__-1 "i love the colors and style of this poncho however the fabric is a total miss . it is so scratchy i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it . also unfortunately the fabric is not woven tightly so the poncho does not keep you warm the wind whips right through it . it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill . i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back ."
__label__1 "love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them . they are so comfortable ! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for ?"
__label__1 "these bottoms are comfortable soft and fit perfectly . the pattern is exactly the colors online ."
__label__-1 "i want to love this shirt i really do but it 's huge ! the top is tent-like which would be adorable with skinny jeans however the length of the back dips so low the top kind of reminds me of pajamas . the color is beautiful more like a light grey heather and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material . overall the top is cute but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front . sadly it 's a return ."
__label__1 "wish i had snagged both styles of this shirt before they sold out . this is a very cute work appropriate top - good weight and quality to the shirt . i wear a lot of black and white at work ( so sick of gray .. why are all business clothes gray ? ) and this top will be added into my regular rotation ."
__label__1 "i bought three -- in part because they were on sale . i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though . they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go bra-less . that said they may look cute with some of the lacy-show-me bras that seem to be trendy right now . i am typically a small and bought x-small . the drape is not that different in the two sizes but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size . all-i"

__label__-1 "i had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy . im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest . not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver . would n't recommend it ."
__label__0 "this is a lot shinier in person and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size . there is a hi-lo hem going on that does n't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side . due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band it can get crumply on the side if you do n't get the right size . the material feels a little thin and scratchy ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this in the mail ... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel ! i do n't know why it looks like a normal length on the model . im returning it ."
__label__0 "very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and could n't zip up the 8 ( am a 36c and thick/broad at the top ) as there is no give . this is also more like a fitted shirt made of lightweight muslin-like fabric . was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly air conditioned office setting so sadly it did n't work for me . could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami ."
__label__1 "this is absolutely beautiful . the picture online does n't do it justice . i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly . fit was a little large . i would have tried a petite but this shirt does n't come in petite sizes . love this !"
__label__0 "i love this suit ! the pattern is just lovely . unfortunately i have to return the suit because i ca n't wear it . there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest . you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this . if you need any support than give up . who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all ? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts . the birds of paradise are just lovely not exactly the same on every suit but still nice . i just"
__label__-1 "i initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model . it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant . then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders . i 'm regularly a size 2/xs 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me ."

__label__1 "count me in as a five star lover of this dress ! the details are so rich and interesting so be prepared to get noticed when wearing . i 'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular ( instead of petite ) was a good choice for my top heavy frame . the chest is fitted but not tight the length is a not-too-short above knee the tiered layers swing so nicely and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design . my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie -- soo heavy cumbersome to style . o"
__label__-1 "i ordered this in a small petite and medium petite and i am a huge fan of a * k. i put tried on the sp . while it fit it was very long even for a petite . what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide . even a long necklace would n't help deter the look . on a positive side the blue was a very nice cool color . i am usually a small to medium in a * k ( 6-8 in tops ) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice just too much fabric for me . returning !"

__label__0 "i bought the stained glass top/bottoms . the print is very pretty . however the tankini top itself is not well-made . the front of it ( chest area ) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit ( which is white ) . it does n't lay flat around the top and so it shows more of your chest on one side . for the price i do n't think it is worth it . i do n't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable ."
__label__1 "this top is full of amazing details . the photos really do n't do it justice . it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue . i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5 ' 5 frame but because of the detailing ... it just works ."

__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 9 and 155lb . i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms . it made me look like i was taking off ... much more beautiful on the model . a medium would e been too big on my torso . the color is amazing ! made my blonde hair really pop . i do n't love green but this was so different . would love to find something else in this color that suits me ! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this !"
__label__1 "i purchased this shell in black . the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality like as shown . i am 5 ' 4 120 # and typically purchase an xs . this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews but i am overall happy with the top . the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust ."
__label__0 "i bought this tank for work but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo . i usually wear a xxs or xs ( i am 100 lbs 5 ' 1 ) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose which i wanted . the arm holes were down to my waist and it was also unusually wide . the quality of the fabric is nice though not to heavy and not too thin ."
__label__-1 "there 's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut . i ca n't move my arms in this dress . otherwise the fit was fine . the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds . other than that the does nothing for your figure . i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5 ' 1 . do n't buy it . i know it 's tempting with the sale price ."

__label__-1 "i grabbed my typical size ( 8 ) and found it fit snug in the bust . the fabric has plenty of stretch so the snugness was fine especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front . it 's lowcut but i did n't feel particularly exposed . i ended up not buying it because i do n't think it fit my body right . the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole"
__label__1 "when i received this blouse ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky . some of the fabric would stick to these dots . i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid . however after hanging on my closet door the dots are still sticky . i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me ."
__label__0 "this top is gorgeous in person but when i tried it on i fell out of love . it did n't happen immediately but the more i wore it around the fitting room area the less i appreciated its beauty . i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5 ' 8 140 lbs for reference . this top is just huge in the body ! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering . yes it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo 's ! this was just a miss for me ."
__label__-1 "uhm no . oh dear no . i was initially drawn to this blouse 's lovely fabric the color and pattern are truly stunning . i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy oh boy was i right . sadly this is one of the least flattering tops that i 've ever tried on at retailer . it might be a great maternity top though ."

__label__0 "i love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut . the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material . it is just too much for a summer dress . it just felt heavy and hot . i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over ."

__label__0 "the dress immediately caught my eye in the store . upon trying it on i discovered that the slip runs extremely small ( and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift ) . the skirt is a tad long -- i 'm 5 ' 6 and it hits mid-knee . it 's a shame the slip was so tight -- i loved the dress otherwise ."

__label__-1 "these look nothing like the picture ! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture . i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90 's that just fit terribly . i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it . the color was also much lighter than shown in picture . super unflattering & just not for me . they 're going back ..."
__label__0 "i think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i do n't know how i would use this top . i do n't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops ( if people see my bra slightly so be it ) but this is really sheer unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this and in my mind that defeats the purpose of a lightweight sleeveless top . i returned it and was sorry to have to do that ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person . the fabric is a rough gauzy texture . the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something they do not hang or move well on the body . also they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off . sadly these are going back ."

__label__-1 "i love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25 % off sale . i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress is n't even silk or a better material . but once i got this i was so disappointed i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me . i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress . plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way . i do n't even want t"
__label__-1 "there are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted . not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress . i wish the pictures shown were more accurate ."
__label__1 "this skirt is gorgeous- the picture does n't do it justice . it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material . i received tons of compliments on it . the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily . in a short 2 hours of wearing it the material was already pulled in two different places . i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time ."
__label__0 "the fabric is wonderful flows nicely and soft . i am 5 ' 7 145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine . after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger . there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a pooch never a good thing . i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung"
__label__0 "a beautiful blouse ; however i assumed from the photo that it had a lining . it does not and the blouse is very sheer . it seems to run a bit small also and if i add a camisole it might be too tight . the length is adequate . i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine ."
__label__1 "this dress is beautiful in person . i am 5 ' 1 and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect . i only need 2 inch heel and it will be fine . details on the flowers are really nice . one more plus it machine washable ."
__label__-1 "when i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned . i got the black w the white collar/cuffs . i thought it was terribly itchy material ( which could be remedied w a shirt underneath ) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color . maybe the other colors are better ?"
__label__-1 "this dress is very thick cotton material . like a sweatshirt . i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best . the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric ."
__label__-1 "terrible fit for a longer torso . runs small in hip and lining huge in the waist . not good for an hourglass figure !"
__label__-1 "i should have heeded the previous reviewer 's advice . but i 'm really short so i thought i 'd give it a try . there is something really wrong with the bust . first it 's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be . the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust . even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups they are really only designed to fit cones not curves . from the side it looked hideous . too bad because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous ."
__label__1 "i adore this sweater .... so happy that i was able to get one . get random compliments from strangers all the time !"
__label__-1 "i have had this shirt for a little over a month . i 've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder . it 's not even on a seam so i ca n't fix it . i expect much better quality from retailer . do n't buy this . the quality is very disappointing . which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts ."
__label__0 "beautiful color and softness very warm but the front is way too much material . it just was n't flattering the way i wanted it to be . perhaps on a taller woman this would work ."
__label__-1 "this top runs super small in the upper arms shoulder area .. could not even stretch out my arms ! ... other then that major problem the length and body fit were perfect ... i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10 12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit ... disappointed because it really is a beautiful top ..."
__label__1 "i was n't sure how to rate the fit on these . i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there 's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area . i tried a 10 but the waist did n't fit . i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print . there is no stretch in these either . i have slim legs- if you do n't i would size up or just pass . the calf is tight ."
__label__1 "i threw this into my cart online on a whim but i 'm not disappointed ! and i do n't even wear rompers usually . for reference i 'm 5 ' 2 and normally a size 2 and i bought this romper in a size xs petite . if you 're on the shorter side i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes . the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me and the shorts are about medium length . i like the neckline details . the armholes in the petite size are n't"

__label__-1 "beautiful fabric ! unfortunately i had to return it . after just one wear it had pills all over the side . fabric is too delicate . sad to return !"
__label__0 "disappointed this did n't fit better . the pockets stuck out on the sides and it was baggy through the middle . you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress . the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture . it 's really pretty !"
__label__-1 "too big and it 's not secure enough to wear for swimming ."
__label__1 "i received the pants and they are really nice . you can dress them up or down . i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs as they were loose . i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites . i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular . the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult ."
__label__-1 "this dress is a potato sack ! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird ! ! and it 's huge on me so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not . also the fabric is strange not at all what i expected . i 'm so sad : ( i was really excited about this dress ."
__label__-1 "i & # 39 ; m taller ( 5 & # 39 ; 8 ) so it & # 39 ; s not uncommon for things to be too short on me but this was really short for the style . it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below . the style really just did not work with the length . it looked very odd ."
__label__0 "i was really excited to receive this dress . it 's a fun concept and different from anything else i have . however the dress was way too short on me . i 'm 5 ft 6 in . and the size medium was way too short . given the thin nature of the material i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress even for wearing it outside the office . i will have to return this dress ."
__label__1 "just bought this weekend and had to size down . i 'm usually a small in jackets and went with the xs . retailer has had this style for the last few years and i 've missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out ! ! well worth the price point . i think it will be a very versatile jacket . for sizing reference i 'm 5 ' 7 and 135lbs ."
__label__1 "i normally wear a 4 and that technically fit if i did n't plan to sit . i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe . it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress . needless to say i 'll wear it on our next date .."
__label__1 "wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle"
__label__1 "the color is deep coral and perfect for fall to top jeans or leggings . i love the big slouchy look so the drapey quality is a plus ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this romper and could n't wait to try it on . it 's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist . if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice but if it sits at my natural waist the back balloons out and it 's unflattering . it 's too bad i love the print and ease of this design ."
__label__0 "i likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit . my bra showed . i am about a d cup smallish in other proportions ( 125 5 ' 6 ) and no bra worked with this so that i would n't have to worry about my bra showing . nice fabric and drape . maybe good for someone who does n't need a bra ?"
__label__-1 "alas i so wanted to love this . the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy drapey ultimate grecian goddess . but it just does n't work unless you 're super-skinny . too much material . almost bulky ; strange looking . the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral and i love the whole idea of the dress . but it just does n't work . have to send it back . ( i 'm 5 ' 6 135 pounds 38-30-38 and i ordered a 10 . )"
__label__1 "this top is just darling ! the body of the top is lightweight sweatshirt type material that 's dyed to appear well used . the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured . great to wear with leggings ! the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered . extremely comfortable machine washable . an unexpectedly nicer than it looks online garment . i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl ."
__label__-1 "ordered the biggest size available the large . the arms are so tight i could n't get it on . looked like it may have fit in the body so i do n't understand why so constricting in the arms . i do n't have big arms either . fabric is thin but the color is pretty . ca n't recommend . i 'd pass on this one ."
__label__-1 "i loved this shirt ! flattering and pretty . it 's hand wash only or dry clean . i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank and now the front of the shirt is too short for me . would not recommend due to shrinkage ... too bad ."
__label__0 "i liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt . pretty seam down the back and weight of material . i 'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought ."
__label__0 "i thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe and while the color did n't disappoint everything else did . it 's a very loose slub so it 's very see through and thin i 'd have to wear a cami under it . also the tie front has a very high slit ! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt . i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear but definitely not at this price . pass for me sadly ..."
__label__-1 "one of the worst shirts i 've tried in a long time . i do n't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model . in person it is sleeveless huge short and wide ."
__label__-1 "this blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and ca n't be saved . the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just does n't lay right underneath . the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse . i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print . definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25- % ."
__label__-1 "the dress is really frumpy standing up . something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown . the lace is really pretty though"
__label__0 "i bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack . the pattern did n't help anything looking totally faded and washed out ... the fabric and overall quality is nice but the fit and pattern are just so .. ugly unfortunately . had to return it ."
__label__0 "very cute dress just way too big . i ordered it online wish i would have gone a size smaller ."
__label__1 "i was n't sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it 's by postmark and has an interesting cut . i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy . it is that and more ! the lightweight sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring . i look forward to wearing it tomorrow !"
__label__-1 "i put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old . he was right . i 'm not sure if it 's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too . perhaps on someone else it would look different . the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking . it may look better on someone taller ."
__label__0 "i loved these when i first got them . they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i 've ever owned . plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy . unfortunately they stretch out horribly within one wearing . for such a pricey pair of cords i 'm extremely disappointed . i 'm not sure if i should 've sized down but now i 'm wishing i had although i 'm not sure that would make a difference ."
__label__-1 "the cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined . although the color is beautiful the cheap fabric has no variation is too saturated and lacks any sheen of quality silk . shocked at the price . i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre 2010 . being back the quality !"
__label__0 "this shirt is so cute . i ordered a white but will have to return it for a different color . the white is very sheer/shee through !"
__label__-1 "i just received this dress wadded up in a bag . it is nothing like the colors shown on line . in the picture it appears blue and white . in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink . the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt . will be sending it back and again remind myself why i should n't try to buy a dress on line ."
__label__1 "love the pattern . the pants are really cute ! perfect for pajamas or casual outfit to go to a fiends house in . they do have a funny seam above the knee but i still find them comfortable"
__label__1 "fits perfect ! ! tank top or bath top . swings nicely and not too tight on top . i ordered large and am a 38 d. sits perfect not long not short !"
__label__-1 "seems there was a design defect in this item -- sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt . i have pretty thin arms so it 's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone . too bad because it 's otherwise a very nice top ."
__label__0 "i love the pattern of the red/orange dress . i bought this online for easter . i 'm bummed . i felt frumpy . the dress fit . i 'm 5 ' 5 athletic build and i bought the xs . it is just not flattering on my frame . i looked like i had big hips the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that ... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it . my husband agreed i should return it ."

__label__1 "i had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long ( they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered ) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size . i love it ! it is a little long in the back but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt . so cute with skinny jeans and leggings ! it is one of my favorite fall tops ! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays !"
__label__0 "i love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off . it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear . i do n't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work . it is a shame because i really liked the look of it ."

__label__0 "i love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they 're practically made of nothing but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric . however they run very large . being 100 lbs and about 5 ' i typically buy size 0 or xs but these looked a bit ridiculous on me with how big they are . i tried shrinking them in the wash since they 're 100 % cotton and that helped some along with getting rid of the creases from shipping"
__label__0 "i love this fabric and the design details of this top . but i am only 5 ' 3 and this top ends above my waist ! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering . i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is . tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out for someone without a perfectly flat tummy ."
__label__0 "skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric . was not flattering and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50 $ to get it tailored . usual size oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large . the pattern on the skirt and the nuetral color is very nice . if you can find one that fits would be a nice 3 season skirt !"

__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model . however in person this dress is cut like a sack . it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt at least on me . it was oddly shapeless even with the belt . it seemed a size too large . i ordered the xxsp . for reference i am 5 ' 1 and 107 lbs . i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c"

__label__0 "i have a few pairs of the stevie ankle so i thought i try these . they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist . the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent ... like white stripes . they make the jean look overall cheap . not worth $ 198 in my opinion ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however the fit was awful ; . the dress was heavy with a funky liner . it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place . it ran true to size but i have a large chest ( 32dd ) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else . sadly dress had to be returned ."
__label__1 "i ordered the red motif in size xl . for me the fit matches the model so i think it 's true-to-size . the only larger area on me is for the armholes . i use a cami so my bra wo n't show when raising my arms . since it 's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length it 's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape . but overall it 's so soft and comfortable . the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful . prettier in person . there 's no problem with pattern placement either . a great top for summ"

__label__0 "i ordered this in lime which is one of my fave colors . the garment was loose and roomy and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist i would have been in love ! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies ' room i had to plan ahead . i took it on a trip and did n't have time to try on prior to leaving ."
__label__1 "this skirt is so cute ! ! highly recommend super easy to dress up or to dress down . it is n't shown as well in the picture but it has really intricate and pretty detailed stitching throughout the skirt . i have gotten so many compliments on it random people have even stopped to tell me how much they like it and where they can find it . it runs a little small so i recommend buying it a size up . also if you 're taller like me it is a little short in the back . overall a great buy !"

__label__0 "i love the pattern ( red motif ) but the sizing of this dress is way off . the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart . the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching . i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5 ' 9 170 # bra size 34f and 40-41 hips ."
__label__0 "super soft super cute but too short for a dress too long and too overwhelming for a shirt and did n't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i 'm returning . love the colors feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional ... having said that .. fits tts i guess ."
__label__0 "this dress is beautiful but the bottom half was too tight for my shape ."
__label__0 "the straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband mostly caused by the pockets . their openings protrude out right below the waistband . it 's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips they give the impression of extra hips . if not for that silhouette issue i would keep the trousers as they are comfortable and pretty and unlike my other trouser options . not see-through as i feared ."
__label__-1 "i was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater . the sweater looks like it 's falling apart and it is huge . i would not recommend this even at a clearance price ."
__label__1 "softest denim -- they feel like they 've been through the wash a hundred times already ! i 'm pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me . i 'm 5 ' 4 and bought the petite for a perfect fit . these will become a go-to pair !"
__label__1 "this lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality . it is a substantial weight for fall a deep vivid blue color and just the right length to wear with boots . it was a trifle snug in the waist . i would have kept it anyway but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way . at this price it just was n't right for me ."
__label__-1 "these pants were wonderful ... for 2 seasons . yes for almost $ 200 a pop they do n't even last a full year ! loved them so much i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair . all 4 started to rip in the same spot ! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days . fortunately retailer was wonderful ( as always ! ) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money ."
__label__1 "the little details are just beautiful . the embroidery and tassels are so cute . loose fitting just floats over the body . feels very light ."
__label__-1 "this top looked positively vulgar on ! ! ! ! i am a 34d and it was way too low cut ... my boobs were spilling out ! ! ! in addition the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth ..... it just looked and felt cheap . unfortunately this top will be going back ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in the pink color . the fit was fine but i did n't care for how thin it was . there is lining which i suppose is there to combat the thinness but it 's only in certain places . the lining should have been all over . maybe if i had gotten this in blue it would n't have been so bad ."
__label__1 "loved this skirt . it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer ."
__label__0 "i have mixed feelings on these . i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture . they are true to size cute and comfortable . i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes . plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas . i 'm not sure if this was a bad lot but back to the store they went ."
__label__0 "the design of this dress is very cute but if you have an average to large bust do n't even think about it . returned unfortunately ."
__label__1 "this skirt is a keeper . great quality . beautiful color . great fit !"
__label__1 "i sadly only noticed this top once on sale . i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big i would need the petite so i had to leave it behind ( 115 lbs 30dd ) - but it is adorable can be dressed up and classy casually with jeans or sweetly so many ways ... love the subtle polka dots ... oh well i am sure i will find something similar i love !"

__label__0 "at 5 ' 5 ( almost ) 122lbs . i always wear a size small . however this dress runs large ( no i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago ) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me . too bad i really wanted it to fit ! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated and would be an excellent travel dress . i may try the xs . . ."
__label__1 "this blouse is gorgeous . first of all it 's cotton ! so it is extremely comfortable . it is n't tighter in some areas more than others but fits evenly throughout which although a rarity is wonderful . finally a blouse that fits perfectly ! i am 5 ' 3 and 108 pounds . i ordered the regular xs and it hits right at my hips . i have a longer torso however so although i am not tall the petite would have been too short for me . it is beautifully made and the red is a beautiful crimson on white . grab th"

__label__0 "this top is oversized . i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping . it 's huge . so stick with your normal size or a size down . pretty print . fabric is a bit coarse . undecided about trying a size down because i 'm particular and they did n't wow me . also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same ."
__label__0 "purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself . it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work . the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering . the one problem was that when you raise your arms the sweater also rises to expose your torso . it was returned ."
__label__1 "i just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look . it 's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type which is tall and thin . i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman 's frame but it definitely works for me . i 'm 5 ' 9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big ( i often take a medium ) . i definitely recommend this dress ."
__label__1 "i ordered the black 2 months ago it was on back order and i jsut received it finally . the fabric is super soft itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one . the v in front where it crosses is low so most people do need a cami underneath but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look ( not my style but could be done ) . i plan on wearing this with skirts deresses and slacks ... i saw a commet on the lighter color not sure but love this one in black for sure @"
__label__-1 "i fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it ! unfortunately when i went to put it on there was a hole running down the seam in the back . i went to store to exchange wore the shirt and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt . horrified i went home took a look both holes along the seam ! i will be returning this i really liked this shirt !"
__label__1 "i also agree that this piece ran very small . my normal size did not zip up . i sized up a size and it pulled across my thighs . i sized up two sizes and it fit as i had hoped it would . if you get the right size it is beautiful on . the colors are so fun and i love the side slit . i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer and it is definitely a statement piece ."
__label__0 "the breast and arm area is too tight . best to size up two sizes . the blouse runs too small overall . the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo . it 's a pretty blouse and great quality ."
__label__0 "super cute but order at least one size up"
__label__-1 "cute but very itchy ! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath !"
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store in the xs size . the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall . having said that i did not buy it and probably wo n't unless i find it on the sale rack later . it is really more of a poncho than a sweater . the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size . it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall . i would only wear it with a shirt underneath . the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder but start further do"
__label__1 "love the clean lines the texture and the slight sheen on this skirt which does run a bit large in the waist . the online photos are very true to what the fabric looks like . it is a stiffer but lightweight fabric so the skirt stands away from the body . the quality of the finish is excellent and i really appreciate the hidden zipper and pockets . . fit : runs large in the waist . the size 2 i have measures 27 on the top inside of the waistband and i think the model is wearing a size too loose oth"
__label__1 "so i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite . i did n't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot . the dress came today and it fit great . i am 56 so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable . the material and cut is great . this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition ."
__label__0 "this top is beautiful aesthetically and i liked the tunic length . the bottom lace is cut out so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings . the fit is flattering . however i had some issues with the sizing . i usually wear an xs or a s in tops . the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me which is seen on the model .. i tried the top with a belt which looked nice . however the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area . the s"
__label__-1 "so these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail . however on me they were very long ( which i knew ) but too thigh-hugging for my taste and the buttons looked cheap ( i ordered the tan color ) . thus back they went . for reference i am 5 ' 5 and 125 # and ordered the 6 ."
__label__-1 "i have purchased a lot from retailer but lately some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost this being one . the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this . the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves ."
__label__1 "i have this tank in all colors ... it is superb for layering ... comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline ... and it 's long enough !"
__label__-1 "so this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer . this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute . it looked a million times cuter in the photos ."
__label__0 "i would give it a 3.5 if half star possible . like other reviews said the material is a little cheap and back zip got stuck when i tried to unzip it before trying it on . overall nice color and flattering look that could be dress up or down . i am 5 ' 8 155lbs 36b and m is a little snug for me on the top ."
__label__-1 "i love the idea of this top but there is just way too much fabric involved in person ! i 'm 5 ' 2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest . i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering . i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it . i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back the silhouette is nothing like shown . if there were just less fabric i wo"
__label__0 "i am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it 's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best . the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit ."

__label__1 "these cords are a great skinny fit . they seem true to size for me and look great on . only issue i would have is the color says navy but they are more of a deep purple-ish color . i had to recheck my order because they definitely are n't navy .... but i 'm keeping them because the fit is awesome ."
__label__1 "i really loved the material and the feel of this item however it does run very large . even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings ."
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me . it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders however i 'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me . the quality is nice . it is medium in weight . it has a cottony feeling but it not super soft . it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me . i wanted to love it but i only just like it . i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun loose look in a sweater ."

__label__1 "these got me so excited for fall . the teal is a color i 'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these . when they arrived though i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch . the fit is snug but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable ! these will be a staple in my wardrobe . i want to order more colors !"
__label__0 "i love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress . unfortunately it just did n't work for me . i 'm a larger busty lady ( size 14 ) and i tried on the xl . it fit fine but did absolutely nothing for my figure . it just kind of hung on me . even with the belt tie i still feel like it did n't accentuate my waist line . i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure ."
__label__0 "i was so excited when i saw this dress ! i love this color and the poplin sleeves . i was so sad when i tried it on though the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way . i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips . strange . also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality . i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top"

__label__-1 "what a disappointment and for the price it 's outrageous !"
__label__0 "as with most retailer tops this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle . i ordered an xs . it 's a very nice pretty sweater that i 'm going to try in an xxs . the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath . the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale . the white is a soft winter white ."
__label__-1 "loved the material and the style . unfortunately my fears came true when i received this swimsuit and there was n't enough support despite a review i had read . as a 36d i thought the halter would be enough support however the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely . i am sad i wo n't be keeping this though . the material is heavenly ! ! !"
__label__-1 "do n't be fooled by the image ; unless you have a c/d chest this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle -- exactly where you want it least ! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality . back it goes !"

__label__0 "i purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black . the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything . i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it 's thin and see through . if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it !"

__label__1 "this is a beautiful skirt . great soft draping fabric . fringed along the edges . i ordered size large which was an okay fit perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist . because i carry my weight in the tummy this made me look wider than i am . as an elder i just could n't handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee . i have great legs but my knees are n't their best feature . so sadly returned but i do recommend ."
__label__-1 "i tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress . there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress ."

__label__-1 "this top is very beautiful and the color is a dream but wow is it short ! i 'm 5 ' 8 and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans . the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected . it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse . because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt i would n't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top . it made my chest look huge ! this styling may work for petite ladies but tall & curvy ladies beware ."

__label__1 "i bought this dress for my upcoming rehearsal dinner in early fall . i love the romantic lace and ivory color for the occasion . i ordered my typical size 10. it hits me right where it does on the model and it fits well on top but the dress bells more than the images let on . i did n't want to size down in fear that the neck would be too tight so i took it to an alterations specialist to get a lot of the lace fabric trimmed off . she took it in a little at the waste and the underarm and hacked q"
__label__1 "i bought this top about 3 weeks ago & love it ! i like it because it 's better than a plain t-shirt so it 's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping . i like the material and the length i 'm 5 ' 8 and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short . i wash it and hang it to dry no shrinking or pilling so far ! i am ordering this in at least two more colors !"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress . i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors and thought that the green color would be perfect . it is well made but the fabric is lighter than expected . the biggest issues was the size . i am 5 ' 7 and typically a size ten . i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge . if you order this i would say size down two sizes ."
__label__-1 "wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone . but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite not keeping this . the side zipper- a complaint by many really made it uncomfortable . also the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd . loved the material and definitely the green print . but i knew i would never wear it . just looked blah ."
__label__0 "when i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment . well i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but .. the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it 's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik"
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews but it just did n't work for me . the pattern is amazing ( almost a little over powering making it one of a kind and unique ) but what i did n't like the color of the knit collar and front bands -- -- it 's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color . i probably would have kept it if that color was different . it was returned to find a different coat style sweater ."
__label__1 "very pretty dress but the fit is not great . i have to get help to take it off because it 's tight in the shoulders ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan . unfortunately however i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach . the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger . the quality seemed okay but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long ."
__label__1 "like other reviewers i 'm glad i sized down . this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality lightweight chambray . i love that it has pockets but they do puff a bit at my hips ."
__label__-1 "just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper . it 's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer 's picture does n't match the actual product . it does fit true to size however ."
__label__0 "i ordered this top online and was hoping to love it however it did n't fit me properly ... the arm holes were much too large ( i 'm typically an xs or small ) i ordered the small and based on this fit i do n't think the extra small would 've fit either : ( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin .... and with 3 kids always hanging on me i do n't think this top would last very long ..."
__label__-1 "i fell in love with this cute top however after reading reviews i am going to return it . seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions . who wants to dry clean a tank top ? not me sadly . too bad . style was cute and color was awesome ."
__label__-1 "i was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip . i already had my outfits planned ! when these pants arrived however they were very different from those shown in the pictures online . firstly the pants are in actuality quite cropped . i am 5 ' 9 -- the model in the pictures is at least that height if not taller -- and the hems were several inches above my ankles . secondly the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what 's shown although the width of the pant legs may have"
__label__1 "i ca n't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top . the style is so flattering it does n't bag out to make you look pregnant . the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch . soft fabric drapes beautifully . the armholes are not oversized . the fabric is opaque so no camisole required . i am 5 ' 5 and 120 lbs . and 36a . i purchased size small ."
